Explain what inheritance is.
 Inheritance cna let us create child classes of existing classes.



Explain what polymorphism is.
 Polymorphism means once we got a child class,
 we are able to use objects of that child class wherever we would use objects of the parent class.
 Java will automatically refer to the right methods.
